# Elements of Computing Systems

This repository contains my implementations and exercises from the book "The Elements of Computing Systems: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles" by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken, where I build a computer system from the ground up using hardware and software engineering principles. The software projects in chapters 6, 7, 8, 10, and 11 are written in Python 3.12.

## Assembler
Implementation of a two-pass assembler for the Hack assembly language, converting assembly code into machine code.

## Virtual Machine
Development of a virtual machine that translates VM commands into Hack assembly, providing a high-level abstraction for programming.

## Compiler
Construction of a compiler for the Jack programming language, transforming high-level Jack code into VM commands.

## Operating System
Creation of a simple operating system that provides essential services for the Jack programming environment.

## High-Level Language
Writing high-level programs in Jack, showcasing the full stack from high-level code to hardware execution.

## Usage
To use the implementations, follow the instructions provided in each module's README and run the provided scripts or programs as specified.
